Question - Task 1
You are a developer who accidently went back in time. You canâ€™t return back to your timeline
because you Time machine need to sort array from 10 Gigabytes of unsorted integer data. The
problem in front of you is Machine during that time was not that advanced. You find a device with 1
gigs of ram and 240 Gigabyte of hard drive.
-They are all integers like 10000, 16723998 etc.
-Same integer values can be repeatedly appearing in the file.
Create a function to read 10 gigabytes of data and sort it. (Pseudo code and logic will also work)

Pseudo code


START
INIT
    segement := 0
    read_completed := FALSE
    completed := FALSE
    input_file := 'MAIN_FILE'
    output_file := 'OUT_FILE'

    FUNCTION ReadNext10000Lines 
        PassIn: segement, input_file      
        RETURN call Read10000ElementsFileFrom file := input_file, start_from := segement * 10000
    ENDFunction 

    WHILE NOT read_completed
        array = Call ReadNext10000Lines segement
        IF array IS EMPTY
            read_completed := TRUE
        ELSE
            sorted_array = call QUICK_SORT array
            SAVE sorted_array AS 'file' + segement
            segement := segement + 1
        END        
    ENDWHILE

    temp := []
    FOR N as 0 to segement
        temp[N] := call ReadFirstElementAndRemoveFromFile 'file' + N
    ENDFOR
    
    WHILE NOT completed
        index := call indexOfSmallestElementOf temp
        call WriteToEnd file := output_file , element := temp[index]
        temp[index] := call ReadFirstElementAndRemoveFromFile 'file' + index
        completed := call AllElementsAreEmpty array := temp
    END
